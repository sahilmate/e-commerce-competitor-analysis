Apple iPhone 15,"Design
One of the most noticeable changes to the iPhone 15 is its new design. The phone now has rounded edges, which makes it feel more comfortable in the hand. It also has a new camera bump that is less pronounced than the one on the iPhone 14.

Display
The iPhone 15 has the same 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display as the iPhone 14. However, the new display is brighter and has better contrast. It also supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision.

Performance

Apple iPhone 15,Excellent phone. Value for money.,2025-01-28
Apple iPhone 15,"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of use

Pros
- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants
- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here
- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless
- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA
- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome
- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.
- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone
- Apples approach on Security!
- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawless

Cons
- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm
- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchases

Industry memes
- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much
- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!
- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?
- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for texting

Tips of managing battery health
- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh
- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up
- I charge my phone only using a power bank not direct wired or wireless charging
- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%
- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service
- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section
- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc
- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending above

Vendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.

….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience

Apple iPhone 15,Very user friendly. Highly innovative product.,2025-01-28
Apple iPhone 15,"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side, so though it is very good in all aspects, many people may find it very difficult to purchase .",2025-01-28

"OnePlus Nord 4 5G (Mercurial Silver, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage)","I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision.
Best features of this Nord 4 are-
Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all.
Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also.
Battery - If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins.
Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos.
Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all.
Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.

This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....

(If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)

"OnePlus Nord 4 5G (Mercurial Silver, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage)","Bought the phone a month ago. Safe to say at this price range, for me, it's banger.
A fast and smooth software experience and tough and durable hardware.

The oxygen os 15 update made the software smoother and brought some cool features as well. Battery gives an excellent backup, charges quick, the display is great and flat. Also the metal design is unique.

The only downside, or might i say, a slight disappointment is the camera. Not that good at this price. Still and over-all great one. Not even noticeable to the average user.
Apart from that, One plus nailed it.",2025-01-28
"OnePlus Nord 4 5G (Mercurial Silver, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage)","It's not the best phone in this price range but not also the worst. It's an average device for this price range. It's perfect for normal everyday use and little bit a games, but not for photography or high tasks. Display quality is great and the phone is smoother in 120htz. The metal body makes this phone much durable. If you're looking for oneplus phone only, I would tell you to go for 12R, which is a very great choice compared to this with much better camera quality. There has been no heating issue till now and the ui is smooth without any hang. Overall the product is good, but there are better options than this.",2025-01-28

"Sony WH-1000XM5 Best Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic for Clear Calling, up to 40 Hours Battery -Black","These are the best headphones from Sony. Previously I used Sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones. I also used headphones from other brands like Sennheiser, One Audio and JBL but all of them are entry-level headphones. This is the first time I bought high-end headphones and I trust Sony. You can't go wrong with Sony as per my experience. Coming to the headphones, I already knew that these were best. However, I researched thoroughly on YouTube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. I want to get the best value for the price. These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.

Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.

Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.

Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.

Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days, I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.

Update on N.C.:
I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.

Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.

Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.

"Sony WH-1000XM5 Best Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic for Clear Calling, up to 40 Hours Battery -Black","I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music. Was seriously wanting to try the XMs when the XM4 was launched but wasn’t happy with the reviews of mic quality as I generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. But when XM5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. I wanted to give it a try and tried the music when I was in France in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said NO to try with my phone. Back in India I tried again once in a store using my phone and Apple Music and Boy o Boy I was proved wrong!!! I was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the Spatial Audio even with the default EQ setting. I’m not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a Pro quality one in that. With the ANC microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with MS Teams and Phone) I did were fantastic. Decided to grab this and ordered in Amazon when it was available for around 28K net with cashback and I would say this is the best investment I had made. The dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, ANC combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. The size and case as most say as negative isn’t a problem at all. The build also is good and this is a keeper. If you are not worried about the budget and need a headphone that u can use for both work(calls) and music blindly go for this.. 👍🏻

"Sony WH-1000XM5 Best Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic for Clear Calling, up to 40 Hours Battery -Black","4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller slapped bill on original box. for such premium device it is disappointing.
Build and design: I had used these headphones for more than week and I would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.
Audio: Well I am not used to over the ears devices so I cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .After eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.
also audio quality depends upon you device too. as I tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.
noise cancellation: I bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence. As per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. You can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.
But if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)
what more to consider: These cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. It can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.
for other: If you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel It will cut every thing while playing music or movies. Maybe these are designed for this purpose.
Pass though mode: As per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,
Battery I didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but I feel more than sufficient easily last for couple of days if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.
Biggest bummer for me. Its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. I think for this price it should be there, As sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. I had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.

Mas, atenção. ANC não cancela todo tipo de som. Ele foi desenhado para eliminar ruídos brancos, como som de motor, ruído de tráfego, barulho de máquinas, etc. Você ainda irá ouvir sons agudos, como de animais ou conversas humanas. Mas, combinando o ANC com música, você provavelmente não irá ouvir quase nada do mundo exterior. A qualidade do som também é excelente, bem cristalina e balanceada.

"Sony WH-1000XM5 Best Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic for Clear Calling, up to 40 Hours Battery -Black","Venho avaliar o produto, depois de um certo tempo de uso, comprei o mesmo, para estudos, ouvir musicas diariamente e principalmente pelo cancelamento de ruídos. Moro em um local onde as pessoas tem cachorros e usam eles, para alarme, campainha, para cuidar da vida dos vizinhos, resumindo eles latem 24 horas por dia, e como só consigo me concentrar em extremo silencio, ou escutando sons branco, o Fone SALVOU A MINHA VIDA ACADÊMICA e minha saúde mental kkk.
Quando a musica, está ligada, não consigo escutar nada ao meu redor, (estando dentro ou fora de casa) quando a musica esta desligada ouve-se o Som bem ao longe.
O fone é lindo, é extremamente leve, confortável, as vezes passo 10 horas seguidas com ele e as vezes esqueço que estou de fone, ele tem muitos recursos para personalizar o Fone conforme suas necessidades diárias.
Quanto potência do Som, eu achei excelente, para as minhas necessidades, existe um modo de personalizar o equalizador conforme o gosto e cada um.
O vendedor é muito atencioso, responde as perguntas rapidamente, o produto chegou uns dias antes do prazo.
Tive outros 2 fones de uma marca famosa (J..) e não chega aos pés deste fone. Quem está desesperado precisando de ""silencio"" para trabalhar, estudar ou ao menos ficar em casa sem ser atormentados pelos vizinhos kkk ou cachorros dos vizinhos, comprem, não irão se arrepender.

"Sony WH-1000XM5 Best Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic for Clear Calling, up to 40 Hours Battery -Black","I am almost 65 years old SO, I DO NOT have the ears of a 18 year old. That said, I consider these to be good for these reasons:

A: Exceptional battery life.

B: Call quality that was considered good UNTIL I did a direct comparison to my Blueparrott B450-XT’s - NO WHERE NEAR the quality of the Blue 450’s, BUT the Blues are made specifically for calls in noisey environments. . Blues are in my opionion the defacto standard by which all other ANC phone calls should be judged. My ""demo"" for people is to run my upright vacuum cleaner whilst on a call. People on the other end cannot hear it AT ALL – REALLY!, I hear them, and they hear me perfectly! TRULY amazing! I did the same test with these and alas they failed miserably in comparison. I expected that. I was told they sound like I am in a room away from the microphone, a bit fishtank like, and muddy. SO, they’ll do in a call but not as a primary phone call device in noise. I heard a sample of the BOSE 700’s and they were terrible, which is what prompted me to get the Sony’s.

C: One unconventional thing they do great at: A Sleep Aid. Yup, they drown out all the extraneous noises like people talking, Air conditioners, fans, Water coolers, hums, etc. ALL gone with nothing playing through them!

I bought them primarily for playing on my PS5, and watching TV late at night. They do both quite well.

D: Amazingly, my ears do not sweat much in these even after prolonged use. I’ve ordered those Dekoni Suede Earpads for them as well just for added comfort.
(https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BS4T3X62?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
(5/16/23 - Returned The earpads: they claim they are suede when in fact they are 2/3 suede. The inner part inside the cup is something else, not leather so NOT durable. Considering this, $49 seems FAR too expensive.)

E: They are long-term comfortable unless you have ears like a B-52 in which case you will probably be stuffing bits.

As for music, I find them to be more flat without pronounced highs or bass - which I prefer. The EQ on the app is a nice feature. The ANC works very well listening to music and will be adequate to the task in both quiet and noisey settings. Again, I remind you, I’m not 18. ;-)

Pricewise, they ARE a bit expensive but the build quality seems better than most.

If you have the time, I would HIGHLY recommend you test several brands and models at a store simply because sound quality is subjective and EVERYONE has their preference.
UPDATE: 5/23/23 - Returning (REPLACING) Headphones - Why? They started acting ""Funky"". By that, I mean that if you turn them off, they will not turn on unless you do not hit any buttons for about 15 sec. NOT normal. ALSO, they started to exhibit Connection issues that were NOT there initially. I STILL, at this point consider them excelllent. Now, if the NEW pair goes weird, THEN I would have to re-evaluate.
UPDATE 6-3-23: New pair are working as they should no connection issues or on/off bttun problems.
UPDATE 2-16-24: Still working perfectly and I use them nearly every night to sleep.

"Sony WH-1000XM5 Best Active Noise Cancelling Wireless Bluetooth Over Ear Headphones with Mic for Clear Calling, up to 40 Hours Battery -Black","Ready for the best in class noise cancelling headphones with incredible sound profiles completely customizable? I owned them all. AirPods Max, Sony XM3, XM4, Bose 700. The all new Sony XM5’s is the new king of NC headphones.

✔ Much Better Microphone (vs. XM4) – Tested with Zoom/Microsoft Teams business calls and family/personal calls. Performs much better than XM4 previous generation
✔ Long Term Comfort – I can wear them for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort while wearing my glasses. XM4’s felt warm/hot after long term use, XM5’s have more breathability.
✔ Touch Controls – Works flawlessly between swipes and tap. Feels like an upgrade with better sensitivity compared to previous generation.
✔Bluetooth & Connectivity – I take them off, music pauses, I put them back on, music resumes. I walk anywhere in my home while leaving my phone on my desk. Clear sound, no distortion whatsoever, signal transmission remains in-tact and stable at any given moment. I have them connected to my iPhone and MacBook Pro, I’m able to swap between both devices quickly.
✔Hard Case & Wire – The case is good quality, headphones fit perfectly with slot for USB C charging cable and audio aux cable, both included no extra charge.
✔Sony app is full of features. Can customize audio profiles or use presets. The presets are excellent for any genres of music and I often swap depending on my mood. Updates are done through the app. NC and transparency mode can be controlled in the app or by using a button on the headphones. Adaptive sound is nice, it auto detects my environment and changes from NC and transparency. It works in my favor, no complaints. Auto power off is an option, or manually turn them off using the button on the headphones.

I purchased 2 pairs of the new Sony XM5’s – one for my wife and one for myself. We absolutely love using the latest and greater wireless noise cancelling headphones – I can easily say that both Sony and Apple make the best out there. Because I own all the latest NC headphones, I created a comparison below between the 2 best: Sony XM5’ and how they compare with Apple’s Air Pods Max.

Sound Quality: Winner Tied
I tested the XM5’s using Tidal and Apple Music using both wired and wireless. I found the music quality on the XM5’s sound better on specific genres such as Jazz, Bossa Nova, Hip-Hop (90’s), Classical Rock, Symphony, and R&B.
The APM are ahead when it comes to EDM like House, Drum & Bass, along with Pop and other computerized music.

Both headphones are close for most genres, however the biggest difference I noticed between the two was Jazz like genres, with the XM5’s being leagues ahead.

This is a tie because it depends on the genre you prefer.

Audio Enhancements: Winner Air Pods Max
The XM5’s offer 360 Audio Reality which is only accessible to less popular streaming music apps like Tidal, while the APM offer Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio. The audio library for the sound enhancement is also smaller for Sony with limited selections.

Comfort: Winner Sony XM5
The XM5 can remain on your head for long periods of time (several hours) without any discomfort given its lightweight feel. When walking around the house, or outdoors, the XM5’s remains on your head without moving.
The APM on the other hand are heavier and begin causing some discomfort after 1-2 hours. When stationary, they’re fine, but when walking around and tilting your head, they begin to slip off.

Features: Winner Sony XM5
Sony offers an headphones app accessible from the App Store or Google Play Store which allows you to heavily customize your XM5’s, from building a sound profile, selecting audio pre-sets, adjusting noise cancelling, transparency modes and a great deal more.
The APM on the other hand, do not have an app of any kind, besides the ability to select audio pre-sets from the music app you subscribe to.

Transparency Mode: Winner Air Pods Max
The transparency mode on the APM is unlike anything else; I can have full conversations that sound natural. The XM5’s on the other hand are an upgrade from the XM4’s, but it doesn’t sound as natural as the APM.

Microphone: Winner Air Pods Max
The microphone on the APM is excellent; I’ve hosted hundreds of hours of business meetings and personal phone calls; the microphone is crystal clear and professional.

The XM5’s on the other hand is an upgrade from the XM4’s and noticeable a lot better, but the APM are noticeably better. I tested the XM5’s for calls and was satisfied with the results.

Noise Cancelling: Winner Sony XM5
When wearing the APM for a long period of time, my ears feel like they’re going to explode. When I first purchased the APM on the release date, I could use the noise cancelling option for hours however, after over a year, I can no longer handle noise cancellation beyond 15 minutes it gives me severe ear pain and I must switch to transparency mode or take them off and break.
The XM5’s on the other hand, do not cause me any pain, regardless of if I’m listening for 30 minutes or 2 hours. During testing, I listened to music for a long period of time and watched a YouTube for an hour.

I feel that prolonged listening to the APM using the noise cancelling feature caused my ears to become highly sensitive after using them for over a year, with a feeling of severe cabin pressure. This is also worse if using the Bose QC35’s, with pressure being too intense.

I can wear the XM5’s for long periods of time; they manage to block loud televisions and screaming babies. The biggest takeaway is being able to keep them on for several hours without discomfort or pain.

Build Quality: Winner Air Pods Max
The APM are built to look and feel luxurious. From the band, metal, and aluminum components, they feel like the Lamborghini of headphones. The XM5’s on the other hand are made out of sophisticated plastic. Also, the APM has magnetic interchangeable ear cushions that can be purchased separately, while the XM5’s do not.

Accessories & Costs: Winner Sony XM5
Sony offers a real carrying case that protects the headphones and its accessories from damage/drops. Apple has a bra-like case that doesn’t protect the headphones at all, forcing the user to purchase a third-party case online. Also, Sony offers a headphone cable, while Apple requires a separate purchase ($45). This means between the cable and the case; you’re looking at almost $100 of added expenses with the APM.

Moreover, the price at the time of this review is $499 for the XM5’s and $779.00 for the APM. The Sony’s offer a much better value.

Conclusion:
There are many factors to take into consideration between both brands, but ultimately, my heart is with the XM5’s because they sound better for the genres I listen to (Jazz) on a daily basis, and it puts me in the musical ‘zone’. Also, the noise cancelling feature from the XM5’s don’t give me the ‘cabin pressure’ feeling found from the APM. The price difference between both is also substantial given they are close in most categories.
